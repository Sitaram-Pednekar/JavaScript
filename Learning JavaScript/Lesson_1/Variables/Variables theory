1) In JavaScript, variables are dynamically typed

You do not declare the type.

let x = 10;      // number
x = "hello";     // now string
x = true;        // now boolean


Same variable. Different types. JS allows this.

Type belongs to the value, not the variable.

This is a big mindset shift.

2) Ways to Declare Variables

JS has 3 keywords:

Keyword	Scope	Can change value	Old/Modern	Use?
var	Function	Yes	Old	❌ Avoid
let	Block {}	Yes	Modern	✅ Use
const	Block {}	No reassignment	Modern	✅ Prefer
Example
let age = 21;
const PI = 3.14;

3) Scope in JavaScript (VERY IMPORTANT)
Block Scope (let, const)
{
  let x = 10;
}
console.log(x); // ❌ Error

Function Scope (var)
{
  var x = 10;
}
console.log(x); // ✅ Works (problematic!)


This is why var is dangerous.

4) Hoisting (Classic JS Behavior)

JS moves declarations to the top.

console.log(a);
var a = 5;


JS reads it like:

var a;
console.log(a); // undefined
a = 5;


But with let and const:

console.log(a);
let a = 5; // ❌ ReferenceError


This is called the Temporal Dead Zone.

5) Variables and Memory in JS (Critical Concept)

JS has two memory areas:

Memory	Stores
Stack	Primitive values
Heap	Objects, arrays, functions
Primitive Types (Stack)

number

string

boolean

null

undefined

symbol

bigint

let a = 10;
let b = a;
b = 20;
console.log(a); // 10


Copied by value.

Reference Types (Heap)

object

array

function

let obj1 = { name: "Twisty" };
let obj2 = obj1;

obj2.name = "IT Guy";

console.log(obj1.name); // "IT Guy"


Copied by reference (same memory).

This is where most JS bugs come from.

6) const with Objects (Trick Question)
const user = { name: "Twisty" };
user.name = "New Name"; // ✅ allowed


Why?

Because const protects the reference, not the internal data.

You cannot do:

user = {}; // ❌

7) Undefined vs Null
let x;
console.log(x); // undefined

let y = null;

undefined	null
JS default	Intentionally empty
Not assigned	Assigned empty
8) Reassignment vs Mutation
Operation	Happens to
Reassignment	Variable
Mutation	Object data
let a = 5;
a = 10; // reassignment

let obj = {x:1};
obj.x = 2; // mutation

9) The Real JS Variable Model (mental model)

A JS variable is:

A name that points to either a value (stack) or a reference (heap)

name → value        (primitive)
name → address → object (reference)

10) Golden Rules for JS Variables

Always use const first

Use let only if value must change

Never use var

Be careful with objects/arrays (reference behavior)

Understand scope before writing logic

11) One Example That Combines Everything
const user = { score: 0 };

function addScore(u) {
  u.score += 10;
}

addScore(user);
console.log(user.score); // 10


Why? Because objects are passed by reference.







If you want to know more how variables actually are see below it's for general to know more

Think of a variable as:

A named container that holds a value which can change.

That’s the whole game. Everything else is details.

1) The Core Idea

A variable has three things:

Name  →  Type  →  Value


Example (conceptually):

age → integer → 21
name → string → "Twisty"


Name = how you refer to it

Type = what kind of data it can hold

Value = what it currently holds

2) Why Variables Exist

Programs need memory.

Variables are how programs remember things while running.

Without variables, a program would be like a person with no short-term memory.

3) Types of Variables (Data Types)

The type tells the computer how to store and treat the value.

Type	Example	Meaning
Integer	10	Whole numbers
Float	3.14	Decimal numbers
String	"Hello"	Text
Boolean	true / false	Yes or No
Array	[1,2,3]	List of values
Object	{name:"A"}	Structured data

Type = rulebook for the variable.

4) Declaration vs Initialization

These are often confused.

Declaration

Telling the program the variable exists.

int age;

Initialization

Giving it a value.

age = 21;


Or both at once:

int age = 21;

5) Mutability (Can it change?)

Some variables can change, some can’t.

Kind	Meaning
Variable	Value can change
Constant	Value cannot change

Example idea:

PI = 3.14159  (constant)
score = 0     (variable)

6) Scope (Where it exists)

Scope is where the variable is visible.

Scope	Exists where
Local	Inside a function/block
Global	Entire program
Block scope	Inside { } only

Think: How far can this variable be seen?

7) Lifetime (How long it lives)

Created when program runs or function starts

Destroyed when program ends or function exits

A variable is not permanent. It lives in memory temporarily.

8) Variables and Memory (Important for IT mindset)

When you create a variable:

The computer allocates memory (RAM)

Stores the value

Uses the name to reference that memory location

So internally:

name → memory address → value


The name is just a label.

9) Reassignment

You can change the value:

score = 10
score = 20


Same variable, new value.

10) Key Mental Model

A variable is:

A label for a memory location that stores a typed value during program execution.

That’s the theory in one line.

11) Common Beginner Confusions
Confusion	Reality
Variable stores the name	No, it stores the value in memory
Type is optional	Type always exists, even if hidden
Variable equals value	Variable points to where value is stored
Global variables are good	Usually bad practice
12) Real-World Analogy

Variable = labeled box

Label = name

Box type = type

What’s inside = value

Where box is placed = scope

How long box stays = lifetime
