//In JavaScript, we can declare variables using the 'var', 'let', or 'const' keywords.
//In past We used var but after some times "let" keyword been used oftenly 
//let keyword actually used to create a variable where we can change the value after assignation.

//"const" keyword is also used to create a variable but we can't change the value after assignment.where we can use them as ID and whatever.It fixed.




//let's take Integer as an example where we stores the value of age.
let age = 25;

//now need to print it will print 25 Specially don't use ""
console.log(age);//if we do like console.log("age") this will print "age" not "25" because " " in this what we write print exactly same.


//Now String
let name = "Twisty"
console.log(name);//let's run

//use const
const UserID=1234;

// UserID=55;//this will not run because it's already assigned get's error
//       ^
// TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

console.log(UserID);
